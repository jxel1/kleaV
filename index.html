<h1>Pershendetje jeta ime shpirti im drita ime </h1>
<hr>
<p>Would you be my valentine?
    I'll give you x's and o's,
    Heart shaped candy,
    and a little rose.
    <br>
    <br>
    Would you be my valentine
    and mean everything to me?
    I'll show you anything you'd ever wanted,
    be everything you need.
    <br>
    <br>
    Would you be my valentine
    and look into my eyes?
    Tell me everything you're feeling
    with nothing left to hide.
    <br>
    <br>
    Would you be my valentine?
    The world is yours and mine.
    So many things I want to show you
    with only one place in mind.
    <br>
    <br>
    Would you be my valentine
    and smile that gorgeous smile?
    Dance the day and night away;
    Get lost for a little while.
    <br>
    <br>
    Would you be my valentine?
    Making all my dreams come true
    'Cause this is your special day.
    I dedicate it to you. </p>
